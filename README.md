# What is omnipresence?
Omnipresence is an app allowing you to display every app you want on discord rich presence.

Currently WIP.

# Binary releases
Can be found in Bin/Debug. Download the whole Debug folder as it contains DLLs required by the app.

(I may also add them to the releases tab if I'm not too lazy lol)
# Adding presences
Presences can be edited in "pref.txt".

The structure has to be followed like this:

```
#This is a comment!
[Path to executable to check if running] Example: E:\Code__Blocks\CodeBlocks\codeblocks.exe
[The status to display] Example: Editing Code
[Your App's ID on discord] Example: 576668163350200321
[The App's priority. If more than one is running, it will display the App with highest priority] Example: 1
[The App's Icon, Configured online on discord developer portal] Example: logo160
```

A complete example file comes bundled with the download of Omnipresence.
